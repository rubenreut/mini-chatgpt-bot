- `src/context/ThemeContext.js` → `.tsx`

### Utilities:
- `src/utils/ErrorBoundary.js` → `.tsx`
- `src/utils/conversationManager.js` → `.ts`
- `src/utils/debounce.js` → `.ts`
- `src/utils/speechSynthesis.js` → `.ts`

## Component Architecture Improvements

### Reduced Duplication
- Consolidated multiple `ChatInput` implementations into a single optimized component
- Extracted reusable UI elements into smaller, focused components

### New Component Breakdown
- `ChatInput` - Main container component for the chat input area
- `MessageComposer` - Text input area with auto-resizing capability
- `ToolbarControls` - Controls for system prompt and voice features
- `FileUploadPanel` - UI for file upload options
- `FileAttachments` - Display and management of uploaded files

## Error Handling

Enhanced error boundary implementation:
- Added global error boundary in `index.tsx`
- Added component-level error boundaries in `App.tsx`
- Improved error UI with reset functionality
- Added integration with React Query for cache resetting

## Type Safety Improvements

- Added proper type definitions for Web Speech API
- Enhanced global types in `globals.d.ts`
- Added proper typing for chat-related interfaces (Message, Conversation, etc.)
- Used more precise React types (`React.FC`, `useCallback`, etc.)
- Added appropriate typings for all utility functions

## Code Quality Enhancements

- Improved component modularity following separation of concerns
- Added `useCallback` to memoize functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Cleaned up prop interfaces for better type safety
- Improved file organization following feature-folder structure
- Added proper typing for class properties in utilities

## Accessibility

- Added proper ARIA attributes to UI elements
- Ensured all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Added screen reader friendly text and descriptions
- Improved focus management and tab navigation

## Performance Improvements

- Used React.memo for pure components
- Optimized file processing with batching and proper error handling
- Used React Query for efficient API state management
- Implemented debouncing for input events
- Added virtualization for message list to handle large conversations

## UI/UX Improvements

- Enhanced error states with better UI feedback
- Improved file upload experience with better visual feedback
- Added more keyboard shortcuts and focus management

## Additional Improvements Needed

1. Complete CSS Modules migration:
   - Convert existing CSS to CSS Modules for better encapsulation
   - Create a consistent design system with shared variables

2. Enhance State Management:
   - Remove any remaining "any" types in reducers
   - Add proper type safety for action creators
   - Implement selector functions for state access

3. Improve Test Coverage:
   - Add unit tests for hooks and utility functions
   - Create more comprehensive E2E tests
   - Add snapshot tests for components

4. Enhance Accessibility:
   - Perform a complete accessibility audit
   - Add screen reader announcements for dynamic content
   - Improve keyboard navigation flow
