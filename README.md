- React Context API for global state
- React useReducer for complex state logic

### Testing
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
- Cypress for end-to-end and component tests
- Test scripts in package.json

```bash
# Run Jest unit tests
npm test

# Run Cypress tests
npm run cy:open     # Interactive mode
npm run test:e2e    # Headless mode
npm run test:component # Component tests
```

### Performance Optimizations
- Virtualized message list for handling large conversations
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Async file processing with batching
- Efficient request handling with React Query

## Project Structure

- `/components` - Reusable UI components (written in TypeScript)
- `/context` - React context for state management
- `/hooks` - Custom React hooks
- `/utils` - Utility functions and helper tools
- `/cypress` - End-to-end and component tests
- `/src/**/*.test.tsx` - Unit tests

## Technologies Used

- React with TypeScript
- React Query for API state management
- React Hook Form for form handling
- React Testing Library and Cypress for testing
- Axios for API requests
- react-markdown with remark-gfm
- Prism.js for syntax highlighting
- React Window for virtualization
- Web Speech API for voice features

## Security Notes

This application stores your OpenAI API key in browser localStorage and uses it for API requests directly from your browser to OpenAI. For enhanced security:

- We never send your API key to any server besides OpenAI
- Consider implementing a server-side proxy in production to avoid exposing API keys
- All data is processed locally in your browser

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (desktop and mobile)
- Edge
- Safari (desktop and iOS)
- Firefox

Voice features require a modern browser with Web Speech API support.

## Future Improvements

- Server-side proxy for API requests
- OIDC/OAuth authentication
- More extensive file type support
- Streaming responses
- Collaborative features
- Mobile app wrapper (React Native)
